# D2 Playground

A simple application to write [D2 diagrams](https://d2lang.com/). An official [D2 Playground](https://play.d2lang.com/) already exists, but I tried to run it [locally](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2-playground/), and didn't have much success, so this is something I will use for my own work.

### Running

Simply run `go run .` in the root directory.
